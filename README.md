# [OpenTile](https://github.com/samsmithnz/OpenTile)

An open source solution to build and navigate turn based tile games, similar to [XCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-COM), [Jagged Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_Alliance_(series)#Jagged_Alliance_2) and [Silent Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Storm). 

These files are meant to be the building blocks for creating the data structures to build a tile based game. This does require a UI, (I'm building mine in Unity3D), but a basic ASCII UI will be provided
