# [OpenTile](https://github.com/samsmithnz/OpenTile)

OpenTile is an open source solution to create the building blocks and data structures for a tile based game, similar to [XCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-COM), [Jagged Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_Alliance_(series)#Jagged_Alliance_2) and [Silent Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Storm).  

There is no UI, apart from the ASCII files, but it's being built in C#, with a branch for Unity3d.
